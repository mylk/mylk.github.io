Hello, World!

My name is Kostas Milonas and I'm a software developer, mainly focused in web development,
based in Athens Greece.

I love playing with software, GNU/Linux, cycling and wandering in the city.  
Music can make me fly.

If you want to know more about me, [take a look at my CV](/cv).

So, web development will be the main subject of this blog, but won't be the only.

There are things that took me time to accomplish or figure out, which I will try to transcribe into easy-to-follow bullet lists.
I'd be more than glad if I could save some people's time!

Thanks for reading!
